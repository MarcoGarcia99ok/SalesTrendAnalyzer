# SalesTrendAnalyzer

## Description
This project utilizes linear regression to create a machine learning model that analyzes sales data from a retail store. The dataset comprises daily sales figures for the year 2022, including indicators for holidays, promotions, and the day of the week. The goal is to identify trends, relationships among variables, and patterns of sales growth.

## Features
- Analyzes daily sales data for 365 days in 2022.
- Utilizes a linear regression model to predict sales based on holidays, promotions, and the day of the week.
- Visualizes sales trends using histograms and line plots.
- Explores relationships between sales and independent variables (weekdays, promotions/discounts, holidays) using histograms,     boxplots and bar charts.
- Compares the performance of multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
